# Learn Java Programming

> This workbook is aimed at the primary school level. It focuses on teaching **Java** fundamentals in an *Object-Oriented* fashion.

I'm going to make the assumption that you're here to learn about the Java programming language and that you're new to programming in general. If that's where you are at, then you should follow along each step in this workbook in the order I show you on this page. If you already have some experience in another programming language, then feel free to jump around the various articles, links, code samples, and practice exercises in this workbook.

## First Time Programmers

The best way to use this workbook is to treat this page as the central location for each step. You will probably want to [bookmark this page](Bookmark.md) so that you can quickly find it again. I'm going to include a number of links to other websites and tutorials, just because there are so many good resources out there and it doesn't make sense for me to try and reproduce their content.

Each link outside this website comes with a few *cautionary warnings* however:

- Be careful not to wander far from the direct links I give you here. Each external site will have their own links to other stuff on the web, and since the **W**orld **W**ide **W**eb is such a big place, it's easy to get lost or lose focus.
- I'm not responsible for content on these other sites. So if you see a problem or have a question about what they say, you will have to direct your questions and issues to them.

I *do* have control on what I'm posting on *this* website, so if you see a problem with something or have a question, follow the instructions on the [Contact Me](Contact.md) page.

## Lots of Programming Languages

There are a *lot* of different programming languages out there, and new ones are being created each year. Some languages are similar to each other (Java is a lot like C#, for example), while others are wildly different. That's because each each programming language has a specific *paradigm* (perspective, or "way of thinking") about coding.

Some languages are *Declarative* in nature (SQL, HTML, etc.) - they tell the computer *what* to do, not *how* to do it. Others are *Procedural* in their focus (C, early versions of PHP, etc.), meaning that they focus mainly on telling the computer *how* they want each step to happen - they are focused on *the set of instructions* in their code. Still others emphasize *Structure* in building programs, such as Java and C#, which have an *Object-Oriented* focus. Yet another set of languages take a *Functional* approach where the code is written as "formulas" that manipulate data to produce certain outputs (F# is a good example of this).

This doesn't mean that the perspectives of each language don't overlap. On the contrary, their paradigms frequently overlap. For example, *Object-Oriented Programming* (**OOP**) has *Structure* (objects) as its main focus, but it includes lots of *Procedural* blocks of code that run inside of the objects that you create. Often, when a new programming language is developed, the creators of the language try to design what they see as the best "blend" of perspectives for the types of programs they want to build.

Java is what's known as an ***Object-Oriented Programming*** language. For now, just think of this as being more focused on the "things" in your program than on the "steps" your program takes when it runs.

## Fundamental Concepts

While programming languages differ in their focus and perspective, they still share a lot of common characteristics. Read the article ["What is a Computer Program?"](https://programming-0101.github.io/TheBook/Teach/chapter1.html). Then, come back here to begin diving into the Java programming language.

You can start learning Java without having to install anything on your computer. Go through each of the following interative Java tutorials to get familiar with some of the basics of the language. They are pretty short, taking between 5 and 20 minutes each.

## Getting Serious About Coding

- Get a GitHub Account
- Choose your Coding Tools
- Get a good Java book from the library - [Head First Java](https://epl.bibliocommons.com/item/show/678215005) at the Edmonton Public Library
  - Use the [supplied folder](./src/Head&#32;First&#32;Java/) in this repository as a place to put the code you write from this book.
