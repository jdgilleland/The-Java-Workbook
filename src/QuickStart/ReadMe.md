# QuickStart

For a quick introduction to Java, take a look at the `.java` files in this folder.

- [**QuickStart.java**](./QuickStart.java) is a short, simple class that outputs information to the console.
- [**StartHere.java**](./StartHere.java) is a longer file with lots of comments about various parts of the code. There's also a `// TODO:` item for you to edit on your own.
- [**Calculator.java**](./Calculator.java) gets you thinking about how a Java program can be something a user runs from the command-line to perform some task.
